    "    Basic linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between two variables, typically denoted as \"X\" (the independent variable) and \"Y\" (the dependent variable). In a graph, linear regression is represented as a straight line that best fits the data points. The slope of the line (often denoted as \"m\") represents the change in the dependent variable for a unit change in the independent variable. The intercept (often denoted as \"b\") is the value of the dependent variable when the independent variable is zero. The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fitting line that minimizes the distance between the line and the actual data points, capturing the underlying trend or relationship between the variables."

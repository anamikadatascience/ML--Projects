    "\n",
    "1. Deletion Methods:\n",
    "Deletion involves removing records with missing values from the dataset. There are two main deletion methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Listwise Deletion (Complete Case Analysis):\n",
    "\n",
    "Remove entire records (rows) that have missing values in any attribute.\n",
    "Pros: Simple to implement, no imputation required.\n",
    "Cons: Reduces the effective sample size, may introduce bias if missingness is not random.\n",
    "Pairwise Deletion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyze each pair of variables independently and use available data for each analysis.\n",
    "Pros: Retains more data compared to listwise deletion.\n",
    "Cons: Can lead to loss of observations when variables are correlated.\n",
    "2. Mean, Median, Mode Imputation:\n",
    "Replace missing values with the mean, median, or mode of the non-missing values in the same attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros: Simple to implement, does not require complex calculations.\n",
    "Cons: Reduces variance, might distort relationships and distributions, less accurate for skewed data.\n",
    "3. Interpolation and Extrapolation:\n",
    "Estimate missing values based on existing values using mathematical techniques like linear interpolation, spline interpolation, or time-series methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros: Suitable for time-ordered data, preserves trends and patterns.\n",
    "Cons: Complexity varies based on the method used, might not work well with irregular data.\n",
    "4. Hot-Deck Imputation:\n",
    "Select a value from a similar observation (a \"donor\") to replace the missing value. Donors are chosen based on attributes that are similar to the missing value's attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros: Retains relationships between variables, can handle categorical and continuous data.\n",
    "Cons: Requires identifying and selecting appropriate donors, might introduce noise if not done carefully.\n",
    "5. Regression Imputation:\n",
    "Predict missing values using regression models based on other attributes. Fit a regression model using non-missing data, then use the model to predict missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros: Captures relationships between variables, can handle complex data interactions.\n",
    "Cons: Requires modeling and might introduce error if the regression model is not accurate.\n",
    "6. K-Nearest Neighbors Imputation:\n",
    "For each missing value, find the k-nearest neighbors based on other attributes and use their values to impute the missing value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros: Captures local patterns in the data, works well for structured data.\n",
    "Cons: Sensitive to the choice of k, computationally expensive for large datasets.\n",
    "7. Multiple Imputation:\n",
    "Generate multiple imputed datasets and analyze each separately. The results are combined to provide more accurate estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros: Captures uncertainty around imputed values, provides accurate standard errors.\n",
    "Cons: Can be computationally intensive, requires generating multiple datasets.\n",
    "8. Imputation Using Machine Learning Models:\n",
    "Train predictive models (e.g., decision trees, random forests) to predict missing values based on other attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros: Uses relationships between attributes, potentially accurate for complex datasets.\n",
    "Cons: Requires training and tuning models, may introduce overfitting.\n",
    "9. Indicator Variables (Dummy Variables):\n",
    "Create an additional binary variable to indicate whether the original value was missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros: Preserves information about missingness, can be useful in analysis or modeling.\n",
    "Cons: Increases the dimensionality of the dataset.\n",
    "The choice of method depends on factors like the nature of the data, the extent of missingness, the potential impact on analysis or modeling, and the desired level of complexity. It's important to carefully consider the trade-offs and choose a method that suits the specific context and goals of your analysis.\n",

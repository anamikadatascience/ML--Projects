    "2.Visualization: Reducing dimensions aids visualization, helping us grasp patterns and relationships in data that are hard to see in high dimensions.\n",
    "3.Noise Reduction: Lower dimensions can help remove noisy or irrelevant features, enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio.\n",
    "4.Overfitting Prevention: Fewer dimensions reduce the risk of overfitting, where a model fits noise rather than underlying patterns.\n",

    "     Major Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Information Loss: Reducing dimensions can discard important data, leading to loss of valuable insights.\n",
    "2.Complexity: Choosing the right method for dimensionality reduction can be complex, and improper reduction can distort the data.\n",

As the number of dimensions increases, data becomes sparse, distances lose meaning, computational complexity grows, and reliable patterns become harder to find. This can lead to increased difficulty in analysis, visualization, and modeling"

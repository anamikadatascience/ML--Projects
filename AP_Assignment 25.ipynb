It involves adding up the closing prices of a financial instrument (e.g., a stock) over the past 180 trading days and then dividing by 180 to obtain an average value. This moving average is often used to identify long-term trends and reduce short-term fluctuations in price, helping traders and analysts make more informed decisions about the overall direction of the market."

    "Ans: In the context of machine learning, a model is a representation of a real-world process, system, or phenomenon that captures the relationships and patterns present in the data. It's a mathematical or computational construct designed to make predictions, classifications, or generate insights based on input data. Models can be as simple as linear equations or as complex as deep neural networks, depending on the problem and the data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Underfitting: Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data. It performs poorly on both the training and testing data, as it fails to generalize well. It's characterized by high bias and low variance.\n",
    "Overfitting: Overfitting happens when a model is too complex and fits the training data too closely, capturing noise and outliers. While it performs well on the training data, it fails to generalize to new data, leading to poor testing performance. It's characterized by low bias and high variance.\n",

It's used to quantify uncertainty and obtain confidence intervals without making assumptions about the population distribution.\n",

K-fold cross-validation, for example, divides the data into K subsets (folds) and trains/evaluates the model K times, using each fold as the testing set once. It helps estimate how well the model generalizes to new data and aids in hyperparameter tuning.\n",

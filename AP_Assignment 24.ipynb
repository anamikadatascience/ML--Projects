    "]Yes, it's permissible to use several import statements to import the same module in a Python program. The goal of doing this might be to provide more intuitive access to specific functions, classes, or variables from that module, without having to prefix them with the module name each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "One situation where multiple import statements could be beneficial is when you're working with a large module that contains various functionalities, and you frequently use specific parts of it. By importing those specific parts directly into the current namespace, you can simplify your code and make it more readable. However, this approach should be used judiciously to avoid cluttering the namespace and potential naming conflicts."

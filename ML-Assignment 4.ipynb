    "Outliers in Both Directions: Outliers that deviate in both x and y directions are potential influential outliers that can impact the overall relationship.\n",
    "Outliers in a scatter plot might be due to measurement errors, data entry mistakes, or genuinely extreme observations. They can provide valuable insights into the data and the relationships between variables, but it's essential to assess whether they are meaningful or need to be addressed in data preprocessing.\n",
